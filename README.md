This project forecasts daily hotel room demand for seventeen U.S. properties using statistical, machine learning, neural, and foundation model approaches, all evaluated using five-fold non-overlapping time-series cross-validation. The dataset contains daily demand values for each hotel, and models such as Naive, Seasonal Naive, autoETS, autoARIMA, LightGBM, AutoNBEATS, AutoNHITS, and the Chronos foundation model are implemented to compare forecasting performance. Evaluation metrics including Mean Error, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE are computed for every hotel, and Chronos produces the most accurate results overall, followed closely by the neural models. Final twenty-eight-day forecasts are generated by retraining each model on the full dataset, with results stored in organized CSV files and accompanied by visualizations for all seventeen hotels. This repository includes the complete Colab notebook, all forecasts, all evaluation outputs, and fulfills the ISA 444 project requirements while demonstrating the business relevance of accurate hotel demand forecasting for revenue management and operational planning.
